This will be a Platform for the vacation rental cleaning company I work for (Turnovur) to keep
track of it's contractor's from onboarding to schedule updates.

Contractors will have the ability to sign up or log in with validations.

After they log in, they will be directed to their profile page that will show some of their information
and have some action items at the bottom. 

(This feature would be nice)Contractors can submit time off. Only the first text input and 
date selector would be mandatory to submit the form.

Contractors can also view their onboarding checklist and complete the items on that list. Once 
the list is complete their status will change to "Training Completed"

Contractors will have the ability to edit their information

Contractors can view Team Announcements that have been submitted by the admin

Contractors can set and update their availability as well as see the status of their time-off requests.

Admin will have seperate views and capabilities. Admin must have verified credentials.

Admin will be able to view and submit announcments for the team.

Admin will be able to see a list of the current contractors along with their onbaording status, their 
start date, and their email.
